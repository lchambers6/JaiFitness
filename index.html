							<h3>Teaching Style</h3>
							<p>Jackie has a teaching style drawn strongly from personal experience practicing yoga while also being a dedicated weightlifter.
								She emphasizes protecting your joints by knowing where to relax and where to engage in your body. Pranayama is one
								of her favorite tools for building introversion and helping you learn more about yourself. She wants to empower you
								to push your limits as well as find your center while discerning between when to do one and when to do the other.

							<h3>How Yoga Serves Jackie</h3>
							<p>From day one, yoga has been the calm during the storm of an overachiever’s life. After starting school at Georgia Tech, Jackie committed to attending one yoga class per week. Her dedication quickly grew and sherealized her life doesn’t have to be a storm at all. Yogic philosophy began to infiltrate multiple areas of Jackie’s life and has allowed her to turn everything around. She now lives in peace and when turbulent moments arise, yoga is always there to help her get through.
							</p>
							<h3>Words of Wisdom for Students</h3>
							<p>Know when to let go. Know when to take control. Both are equally important. The peace that comes from relaxing when you can is phenomenal. The sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully leading is uplifting. Cherish both and strive for balance.
							</p>
							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>Jackie entered the world of fitness through group exercise when she joined a gym in 2010 to prepare for Naval ROTC at Georgia Tech. Unaware of how to use any of the equipment and too intimidated to try, she went to a yoga class and loved it! Yogakick started a passion for fitness which lead her to begin work at the Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center in 2013 as a yoga instructor. She continued her education by completing yoga certifications through SCW, YogaFit, and the Pranakriya School of Yoga Healing Arts. She is a 200 hour RYT through Yoga Alliance and is currently pursuing 500 hours. She possesses a desire to help people discover more about themselves and learn to love their bodies.
